Hello, fellow goofers!

First I'd love to extend my gratitude and thankfulness to the fullest possible extent 
to all those who even bother to try this petty little piece of, if not too serious, 
software developed also in "petty little" hands.

The intangible creation is gently made to enable you guys to figure out some tidbits of 
one of the most beloved and exhausted social networking services, namely, Twitter. 
(And yes, the application was named after this!)

You need three text files to initiate the application as the following:

<user.txt>
User profile is composed of three parts. 
Identification number (string), sign-up date (string), and screen name (string).

Well, you may think the interface is pretty much self-explanatory, 
however, here is "the" manual that may help you somehow 
before getting your hands dirty with the humble apparatus.

** Interface **
=======================================================
0. Read data files
1. Display statistics
2. Get more detailed statistics
3. Top 5 most tweeted words
4. Top 5 users who tweeted the most
5. Find users who tweeted a word
6. Find all people who are friends of the above users
7. Delete all mentions of a word
8. Delete all users who mentioned a word
9. Find strongly connected components
10. Find shortest path from a given user
99. Quit
=======================================================

This is the very entry to the actual use of the application. 
You'll be seeing this over and over again from the moment you start 
the application all the while toward the very last second when you decide 
to kill the program by selecting the "Quit" option. 
FYI, selecting an option is very simple and easy. Look at the menu,
choose the number that corresponds to your interest at the moment and enter it. 
Too easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy, right?

The following is the option-by-option description of the interface, 
just in case things can be confusing and leave you with absolute oblivion...

0.Read data files
: At the very start of the application, you may first want to retrieve some 
data to work with. By selecting this option, you have your application read 
relevant data files and build the database upon which other jobs are handled. 
Unless you can enjoy the true beauty of some empty data box of nothing, 
please select this first! Otherwise, it will anyway call to your attention.
You can exercise the option at any time you want. Plz, just remember that 
this will overwrite and replace the current database.

**Note : All jobs are handled based on the current database***

1.Display statistics
: This will display 3 basic statistics as follows.
(example)
=======================================================
total users: 6995
total friendship records: 69013
total tweets: 92070
=======================================================
Results are not stored anywhere nor can be retrieved in the future. (Sorry!)
You may take some notes (Class-y!) or select the option again!

2.Get more detailed statistics
: This will display 6 detailed statistics as follows.
(example)
=======================================================
Average number of friends: 9.86605
Minimum number of friends: 7
Maximum number of friends: 10

Average tweets per user: 13.16226
Minimum tweets per user: 1
Maximum tweets per user: 113
=======================================================
Results are not stored anywhere nor can be retrieved in the future.

3.Top 5 most tweeted words
: This will display the top 5 most tweeted words.
Results are not stored anywhere nor can be retrieved in the future.

4.Top 5 users who tweeted the most
: This will display top 5 users who tweeted the most.
Results are not stored anywhere nor can be retrieved in the future.

5.Find users who tweeted a word
: You enter a word, and this will display all the users who ever mentioned the word by their user id numbers.
You can choose to store the results in the text file named 'usersOfword.txt'. (e.g. usersOfapple)
You can only enter one word at a time.

6.Find all people who are friends of the above users.
: You enter a user id, and this will diplay all user ids of the friends of the user that you entered. 
You can choose to store the results in the text file named 'friendsOfuser.txt'. (e.g. usersOf449511651)
You can enter one user id at a time.

7.Delete all mentions of a word
: You enter a word, and this will delete all the mentions of the given word.
You can enter one word at a time. The database is updated accordingly.

8.Delete all users who mentioned a word
: You enter a word, and this not only deletes all the mentions of the word but also traces the users
that ever mentioned the word and deletes them, too. You can enter one word at a time.
The database is updated accordingly.

9.Find strongly connected components
: Oops! Yet to be implemented

10.Find shortest path from a given user
: Yet to be implemented

99. Quit
: Adios!
